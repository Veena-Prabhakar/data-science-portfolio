# Data Science Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data science projects demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. Each project is based on real-world datasets and involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and performance evaluation.

## Projects

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Bicycle Journeys**
   - **Description**: This project performs exploratory data analysis on a dataset of bicycle journeys. It focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and deriving insights into journey patterns and passholder behaviors.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Handling missing data, outliers, and time-based transformations.
     - Statistical analysis of journey duration across different passholder types.
     - Insightful visualizations on time patterns and data distributions.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### 2. **Advanced Clustering Analysis - Seed Shape**
   - **Description**: This project applies clustering algorithms to seed shape data to identify natural groupings. Two clustering models are implemented and compared, and the analysis is extended with newly found dataset insights.
   - **Key Features**:
     - K-Means and hierarchical clustering for pattern identification.
     - Data visualization and model comparison.
     - Re-evaluation of clustering performance with updated data.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

### 3. **Deep Learning and Machine Learning Model Comparison**
   - **Description**: This project compares the performance of three different models—two traditional machine learning algorithms and a deep learning neural network—on a custom dataset. The analysis evaluates and compares the models using performance metrics.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Comparison of Random Forest, SVM, and Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch) models.
     - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
     - Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - **Tech Stack**: Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib).
