# Seed Shape Analysis

## Overview
This project explores seed shape data by implementing clustering and other analytical models to identify natural groupings within the dataset. The analysis compares different methods for grouping the data, evaluates the model performance, and explores how variations in the dataset affect the conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## Project Structure
- `31818613_CSMAD21_Coursework-Copy1.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and results.
- `seeds.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for this project (e.g., `sklearn`, `pandas`, etc.)

## Analysis Methods
- **Primary Models:** Two main clustering methods are applied to the seed data. These methods include [e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.]. The notebook discusses the properties and reasons for choosing these methods.
- **Model Evaluation:** Each model’s performance is evaluated and compared. This includes visualizations and discussions around why one model might be preferable.
- **Dataset Variations:** The analysis explores how changes in the dataset impact model performance and results.
- **New Insights:** Additional analysis is performed based on a source dataset comparison, leading to a re-evaluation of previous results.
  
## Project Features
- **Clustering Analysis:** Identifies natural groupings in the seed data and provides insights into the data’s structure.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluates and compares different analytical methods, including clustering algorithms.
- **Data Insights:** Insights into the influence of data variations on the analysis outcome.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Includes a secondary model to enhance the depth of the analysis, exploring additional data characteristics.
