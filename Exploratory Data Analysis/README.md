# Bicycle Journeys: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates a thorough implementation of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of bicycle journeys. The analysis includes data pre-processing, handling of missing data and outliers, transformation, visualizations, and statistical analysis. The project is carried out using Python's powerful data analysis libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Pre-processing of raw data, handling missing values, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Various visualizations and statistics to understand the distribution of data.
- **Data Transformation:** Transformations such as time field manipulation and aggregation.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Tests to compare differences in journey duration based on time or passholder type.

## Insights
- **Average Duration by Time of Day:** The analysis shows that journey duration changes significantly based on the hour of the day, with peak times showing the longest durations.
- **Passholder Type Differences:** A statistical test was conducted to determine if there is a significant difference in journey duration between different passholder types.

## Lessons Learned
- Pre-processing and cleaning of data are critical for extracting meaningful insights.
- Visualizations and statistical methods complement each other in understanding patterns in the data.
